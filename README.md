The-Importance-of-Population-Dynamics-for-Socioeconomic-Development

## Objective: 

To investigate the relationship between population dynamics and economic performance in various countries, with a focus on the impact of population growth on GDP growth, while also considering the potential influence of other factors such as literacy and economic policies.

## Approach: 

Univariate Analysis, EDA, Regression Analysis, Bivariate Analysis

## Conclusion:

Population dynamics and socioeconomic development are closely "intertwined". Our analysis shows that a country's economic progress is influenced by factors such as population size and literacy rate.

There is a positive, albeit weak, correlation between literacy rate and GDP, suggesting that literacy can have a modest impact on economic performance.

The relationship between GNI and GDP is exceptionally strong, underscoring the fundamental role of GNI in determining a country's economic output. The size of the total population shows a moderate positive correlation with GDP, indicating population size does play a role in economic performance.

Urbanization is positively associated with GNI, reflecting the trend of higher income levels in urban areas.

The strong correlation between rural and urban populations implies that changes in one often correspond with changes in the other.
